            <p>NASA’s Space Shuttle program, officially known as the Space Transportation System (STS), was the world’s first reusable spacecraft system capable of carrying astronauts and cargo to low Earth orbit. The program began with the launch of Columbia on April 12, 1981. It included five orbiters: Columbia, Challenger, Discovery, Atlantis, and Endeavour.</p>
            <p>Over the course of 135 missions, the Shuttle deployed satellites, conducted scientific research, and was instrumental in building and servicing the International Space Station (ISS) and the Hubble Space Telescope. Despite two tragic losses—Challenger in 1986 and Columbia in 2003—the Shuttle era remains a hallmark of human spaceflight and technological advancement.</p>
