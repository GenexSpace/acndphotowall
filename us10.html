            <p>Founded by Elon Musk in 2002, SpaceX has revolutionized spaceflight through innovation in rocket reusability and commercial launch services. Its Falcon 9 rocket became the first orbital-class booster capable of returning to Earth and flying again, significantly lowering the cost of access to space.</p>
            <p>SpaceX has launched thousands of satellites for the Starlink internet constellation, resupplied the International Space Station, and developed Crew Dragon to carry astronauts. It is currently developing Starship, the most powerful rocket system ever built, aimed at missions to the Moon and Mars.</p>
